"So, I gave it some thought, and realized that we’d forever be in a deadlock if we continued like this. They wouldn’t agree with our approach, and we wouldn’t agree with theirs. So, we decided to bring in an unbiased third party who didn't have any emotional investment here. We then conducted a longer meeting without any time restraints (so we’d get everything done ASAP in a single meeting), where we went through each idea one by one, and the third party acted as a sort of mediator. When someone pitched something, they also had to back it up with as many facts as possible, otherwise it wouldn’t count.",Action
"“So, I prioritized my tasks by deadlines and complexity, delegated some routine tasks to junior accountants, and worked extra hours to stay on top of everything. I also communicated with my manager about the workload to set realistic expectations.”",Action
"“I created a detailed schedule first. I blocked out time for study, work, and training. I prioritized my tasks by deadlines and importance, so I was often studying early in the morning and late at night. I also communicated with my employer about my schedule to make sure I wasn’t overbooked and I used my weekends to catch up on studies.”",Action
" “Generally, I use scheduling tools like Hootsuite to plan and schedule posts a month in advance, which helps me stay organized. I also set daily reminders to engage with our followers, respond to comments, and adjust content based on performance analytics.”",Action

I also watched my coworkers to learn tips and tricks that could help me be more efficient. When I made mistakes, I tried to take note of them and adjust.

"“I decided to have the team work longer hours whenever the weather cleared up, hoping to make up for lost time. But this led to everyone feeling really stressed and burnt out.”",Action
"“I decided I’d add something new to the website to market the house: a virtual tour. I felt like just photos weren’t enough for this property. So, I rented a 360-degree camera, stayed up watching tutorials, and taught myself how to create the tour.”",Action
